# Movie_Web_Application

An assignment for internship

## Work Assigned

We would like you to build a simple relational database schema to manage a movie database. A movie typically has a name, year of release, ratings, multiple genres, multiple actors, technicians, etc associated with it. You need to create a relational schema with proper relationships between different models/tables using any ORM of your choice if possible.

In terms of APIs, you will need to create these APIs,

- GET and POST APIs to fetch a particular Movie, Add or Update a movie and its related data.
- GET method to fetch all the movies - preferably paginated with custom filters like getting all movies of an actor or a director or a combination of actors/directors/technicians
- POST API to delete an actor from the database if he or she is not associated with any movies
